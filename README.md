# good-natured
Work done in school.
Responsive design example.

This was a non-responsive webpage that I had to make responsive.  Most of the
modifications were done in the CSS file (only minimal changes were made in the
index.html file.)

More specifically, I had to add and customize the two `@media` sections in the
`style.css` file.

Result can be viewed <a target="_blank" href="http://bengudro.insomnia247.nl/code/good-natured/">here</a>.
